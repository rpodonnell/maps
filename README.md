Maps

This repository is for scripts that I've created for mapping purposes. Along with each script will be an image file with a sample output. 

SPECIES_MAP: This script takes latlong coordinates from specimen vouches and plots them on a map, where they are coloured by species epithet. This map is useful for visualising species distributions and identifying populations of interest.

POSTCODE_MAP: This script creates a bubble map based on density figures associated with latlong coordinates. In this case, survey results were tallied and responses were sorted by origin (postcode). Survey responses per postcode were then calculated as a proportion of the total responses, and a percentage figure was generated. Postcode centroid coordinates were generated using a Geocoder plugin for Google Sheets.
